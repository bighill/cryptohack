## Usage

Use docker-compose for a clean environment separate from local host.

```bash
docker-compose run py bash

# or with compose v2
docker compose run py bash
```

Run py scripts in that shell, e.g. ...

```bash
python 000-convert-ascii.py
```

Use that schell to run scripts, but edit files locally.
